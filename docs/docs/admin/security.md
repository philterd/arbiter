# Security settings

The **Security** tab in Admin (`/admin/security`) contains policies that apply to all users
across the deployment.

## Multi-factor authentication

People sign in through Philter, which handles their MFA, so this tab has no MFA setting. To require
MFA, turn on **Everyone must set up MFA** under [Admin → Philter → Settings](philter-settings.md)
(Philter's `mfaRequired` setting); each person then enrolls at their next sign-in. With
Philter's `mfaAvailable` setting on, people can also set up and remove MFA themselves under
[Settings](../user-guide/settings.md#multi-factor-authentication). See
[Sign-in through Philter](../security.md#sign-in-through-philter).

## Data-source host allow-list

Philter Workspace ships with a host allow-list that gates outbound connections to
external systems (OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, Ollama, and any
other URL an admin types into a Test button or saves on a data source).
The allow-list combines two protections: a **default-deny on private-range
addresses** (RFC-1918, loopback, and link-local) and an **operator-supplied
allow-list of public hosts** configured via the
`philter-workspace.data-sources.allowed-hosts` property. Both are documented in
[Data sources → Trust model and host allow-list](data-sources.md#trust-model-and-host-allow-list).

The **Enable host allow-list** checkbox on **Admin → Security** is the
master switch for both protections.

| State | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Enabled** (default) | Outbound endpoints are checked against the configured allow-list and the private-range default-deny. Hosts that don't match are refused with the *"Endpoint host is not on the data-source allow-list"* error. |
| **Disabled** | The allow-list is bypassed entirely. Any well-formed URL an admin enters is accepted. The private-range default-deny is also bypassed. |

The setting is read at request time, so toggling it takes effect on the
next request without a restart.

### Enabling the allow-list

This is the default state for new installs. To re-enable after disabling:

1. Navigate to **Admin → Security**.
2. Check **Enable host allow-list**.
3. Click **Save**.

### Disabling the allow-list

Uncheck **Enable host allow-list** and click **Save**. A red banner
appears on the Security page confirming the switch is off.

!!! danger "Disabling is not recommended"
    The host allow-list is the primary defence against
    **server-side request forgery (SSRF)** through the admin UI. With the
    allow-list off:

    - Any admin (or anyone who has compromised an admin session) can use
      the data-source Test buttons, ingest workers, or Philter/Ollama
      probes to reach **internal infrastructure** the Philter Workspace process
      can route to — internal metadata services, intranet HTTP servers,
      bastion hosts, or other private-range systems that should not be
      reachable from operator input.
    - Misconfigured or hostile data-source rows can be saved against
      arbitrary public endpoints — the operator-supplied URL is no longer
      sanity-checked against a curated list.
    - Cloud instance metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254`,
      `metadata.google.internal`, etc.), which are private-range by
      address, become reachable when they otherwise wouldn't be.

    Disable only as a temporary measure for a known-good, short-lived
    troubleshooting session. Configure
    `philter-workspace.data-sources.allowed-hosts` to cover the legitimate hosts
    you need to reach, and turn the allow-list back on as soon as
    practical. Toggling produces a `SECURITY_SETTINGS_CHANGE` audit row
    so the off-window is auditable after the fact.

## Audit trail

All changes to security settings are recorded in the [audit log](audit-log.md):

| Event | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `SECURITY_SETTINGS_CHANGE` | Admin saves the Security settings form (logged whether or not the value changed); payload names the switch (`hostAllowListEnabled`) and its previous value |
