# Roles and permissions

Arbiter has three roles. Every user has exactly one of them.

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **`USER`** | Group-scoped reviewer. Can read and act on batches/documents in groups they belong to. The default for invited users. |
| **`ADMIN`** | Full access. Manages users, groups, integrations, batches, policies, and global settings. Has the `Limit to my groups` toggle to switch between global and group-scoped views. |
| **`AUDITOR`** | **Read-only counterpart to `ADMIN`.** Sees the same cross-group data an admin sees but cannot mutate state. Intended for compliance, legal, and analyst roles. |

In addition, any `USER` can be designated a **team lead** for one or more
groups. Team leadership is a per-group attribute of the group itself — not a
fourth role. See [Team leads](#team-leads) below.

## Why AUDITOR exists

Compliance reviews, internal audits, and after-the-fact incident investigations
all need someone who can look at every batch, every document's audit trail, and
every reviewer action — without that person also being able to approve, reject,
finalize, or reconfigure anything they look at. Granting `ADMIN` to that person
puts more authority in their hands than the role requires; granting `USER` and
adding them to every group is impractical and grants them write access within
those groups. `AUDITOR` is the dedicated role for this case: full read scope,
zero write scope.

## What an AUDITOR can do

An AUDITOR signs in like any other user and gets the same UI as an ADMIN, with
write affordances disabled. Specifically, they can:

- **See the global Document Queue** across every batch (the `Limit to my
  groups` toggle has no effect — auditors aren't in groups).
- **Open any batch and any document** for read-only review, including
  documents in groups they don't belong to.
- **Search** across every document body in the system.
- **Read every audit-log entry**, including actor emails, and **export** the
  per-document audit history as CSV.
- **Read every reviewer action history** on any span, including which actor
  approved/rejected and any overturn reasons.
- **View the Reports page** — risk-score distribution, throughput, reviewer
  activity — for the full date range and every group.
- **Inspect every Background Job** (data-source ingest progress).
- **Browse the Admin → Users, Admin → Groups, Admin → Data Sources,
  Admin → Destinations, Admin → Philter, Admin → LLM-as-a-Judge,
  Admin → Compliance Profiles, Admin → Approval Rules, Admin → Weight Sets,
  Admin → Notifications, Admin → Security, Admin → Audit Log** pages — every
  page is visible.
- **Manage their own account** in Settings — change password, enable / disable
  2FA, generate or revoke their own API key, set review preferences.

## What an AUDITOR cannot do

The AUDITOR role refuses every non-self mutation. Concretely:

- Cannot upload a document, ingest from a data source, or queue any new work.
- Cannot approve / reject / finalize / unapprove / unreject a document or a
  span.
- Cannot create, edit, or close a batch.
- Cannot create, edit, or remove users, groups, data sources, destinations,
  Philter or Ollama instances, compliance profiles, approval rules, weight
  sets, or notification settings.
- Cannot edit a Phileas policy.
- Cannot break a document review lock held by someone else.
- Cannot trigger an outbound test probe (e.g. the **Test** buttons on the
  Data Sources / Destinations / Philter / Ollama admin pages) — these issue
  POSTs and are blocked.

If an auditor clicks a write affordance that the UI happens to show them, the
server returns **HTTP 403** with the message *"Auditor accounts have read-only
access; mutating requests are not permitted."* The boundary is enforced
server-side regardless of what the page renders, so auditor accounts cannot be
used to write data even by direct API call.

## Feature matrix

A check (✓) means the role can do the action; a dash (—) means they cannot.

The **Team lead** column shows what a `USER` who has been designated as a lead
for at least one group can do *within the groups they lead*. Outside those
groups, a team lead has the same permissions as the **USER** column.

## Group membership

`AUDITOR` does not require group membership and group membership does not
grant an auditor any additional permissions — the role's read-everything
scope already covers every group. Adding an auditor to a group is harmless
but pointless.

## Assigning the AUDITOR role

The role lives in the same field as USER and ADMIN. To assign it:

1. Sign in as an admin.
2. Go to **Admin → Users**.
3. On the target user's row, change the **Role** select from User / Admin to
   **Auditor (read-only)** and click **Save**.

The new role takes effect on the user's next request — they don't need to log
out and back in. The change is recorded in the audit log as a `USER_UPDATE`
event with the old and new role names.

The invitation flow currently still presents only an Admin checkbox; to
invite a new auditor, invite them as a User and edit their role afterwards.

## Team leads

A team lead is a `USER` whom an admin has designated as a leader of a specific
group. Leadership is *per-group*: a single user can lead group A while being
just a regular member (or no member at all) of group B. Their elevated
authority follows them into group A and only group A.

### Why team leads exist

Day-to-day batch operations — creating a batch, setting its Philter instance
or weight set, closing a finalized batch — don't require site-wide admin
authority, but they do require more than what a typical reviewer needs.
Routing every such request through an admin makes the admin a bottleneck. A
team lead is the trusted operational contact for a single group: an admin
designates them once, and they carry the day-to-day batch authority for that
group without being able to touch any other group or any global setting.

### What a team lead can do (in groups they lead)

- **Create a batch** assigned to a group they lead.
- **Change a batch's Philter instance**, **domain**, **weight set**, or
  **review thresholds**.
- **Close** a finalized or rejected batch.
- **See the Batches link in the sidebar.** Regular `USER`s do not see it
  unless they lead at least one group.

In groups they don't lead, a team lead has the same permissions as any
`USER` — they can read and act on documents in groups they belong to, but
not perform any of the operations above.

### What a team lead cannot do

- **Move a batch to a different group.** Reassignment crosses tenant
  boundaries and is admin-only.
- **Anything outside the Batches page.** Team leads cannot manage users,
  groups, data sources, destinations, Philter or Ollama instances, policies,
  approval rules, weight sets, or any global setting.
- **Lead a group they don't belong to.** Leadership requires group
  membership; the leader picker on the Admin → Groups page only offers
  current members of the group as candidates.

### Assigning a team lead

1. Sign in as an admin.
2. Go to **Admin → Groups** and either create a group or click **Edit** on
   an existing group.
3. In the **Members** section, each row has two checkboxes: **Member** and
   **Lead**. Tick **Lead** for any user who should lead this group. (Members
   who are not also marked as leads remain regular users in the group.)
4. Save.

The change takes effect on the leader's next request — they immediately see
the **Batches** link in the sidebar and can perform the operations above on
batches assigned to that group.

To remove a team lead, edit the group and untick the **Lead** checkbox for
that user. Untick **Member** as well to remove them from the group entirely.

## Auditing the auditors

Every AUDITOR action that touches the database — even reads of sensitive
endpoints like the per-document history CSV — is logged in the
[Audit Log](../admin/audit-log.md) with the auditor's email and timestamp.
Auditors cannot edit or delete audit log entries. The log itself is the
authoritative record of what each auditor saw and when.
